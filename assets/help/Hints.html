<h2>Helpful hints</h2>

<p>ServeStream uses a service to play media in the background. Much like the default Android media player, navigating to another screen does not close the service. To properly stop the service you must pause the currently playing media and press your phone's 'back" button. Alternately, you can manually kill the service using the "Running services" application in Settings->Applications</p>
	
<p>When browsing a media server you can save a specific URL by performing a long-press and clicking the save option. This allows quick access to webpages and/or specific streams</p>

<p>When streaming a playlist file (m3u/pls/asx) you can navigate to the previous/next media file in the playlist by using the "previous" and "next" buttons</p>
